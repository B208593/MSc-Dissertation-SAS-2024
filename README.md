# Background
Chest pain is one of the most common reasons why people call the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) via the 999-emergency number. It requires significant resources and has multiple causes and treatment outcomes. To date, no national analysis of chest pain patients has been done within the service. 
# Methods
This retrospective observational study was carried out to provide a service evaluation of SAS, describing demographic and clinical characteristics including treatment of chest pain patients calling emergency services in 2023. As this is the first analysis of the chest pain data, it also provides an overall description of the features of data collection and its’ circumstances.  Data included in the project were based on ambulance clinicians’ notes recorded on the scene. Patients were evaluated performing descriptive analysis in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics and transportation to hospital as outcome.
